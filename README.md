# task-list

This app stores task and time of event about said task. Uses React for a clean UI. Warning, some of the practices shown in the tutorial were not good and this generally was not a good learning oppurtunity. The Instructor did a poor job explaining the features of React so will make another basic react program soon. 

### To use

Not ready for personal use (nor will it ever)
Assuming user has node.js installed and installs JSON-server, Open Powershell and navigate to the task-list foler and run <code>npm run server</code> then <code>serve -s build</code>.

### Guide

The add button will open a form up to where you can save additional task, users may also click the red 'X' to delete a task. Double clicking the task will set or cancel the reminder (There is not actually a reminder).
